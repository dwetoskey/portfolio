        I am a full stack web developer that is completing a full stack web developement bootcamp through MSU. The bootcamp covered the MERN stack and all the building blocks for it. I thoroughly enjoy front end and web design, but I find all of it interesting. If I'm not coding, you can find me spending time with my family, playing guitar, or out on the water fishing. Thanks for taking the time to take a look at my portfolio!
